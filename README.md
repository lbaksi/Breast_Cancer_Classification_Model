Breast_Cancer_Classification_Model

The files should be checked as follow;

1st ipynb file = A_Breast_Cancer_Project - CBIS dataset analysis & mass data modelling (ANN)

2nd ipynb file = B_Breast_Cancer_Project - CBIS dataset combined analysis and combined data modelling (ANN, SVM)

3rd ipynb file = C_Breast_Cancer_Project - Histopathology dataset analysis and CNN Modelling

The Project Summary:
1. Data Collection:
    1. First dataset is CBIS-DDSM dataset(Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM – Digital Database for Screening Mammography).
    2. Second dataset is Breast Histopathology Images saved as png files.  

2. Data Pre-processing:
   1. Process the CBIS dataset; csv files and the images
   2. Definitions, images, missing values, data types, standardization, visualizations
   3. Process the Histopathology Images
   4. Data Augmentation
  
3. Model Building and Evaluation:
    1. Deep Learning Model Building on Histopathology Images – Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
    2. CNN Model Evaluation on Histopathology Images – classification report, confusion matrix, AUC score to assess the model’s performance
    3. Applying different machine learning models including on CBIS dataset 
    4. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Gaussian Bayes, Support Vector Machine(SVM) classification models evaluation on CBIS dataset - classification report, confusion matrix, AUC score to assess the models’ performance

4. Applying the pre-trained CNN Model on CBIS data – work in progress - will be updated later
    1. Create a new deep learning model with pre-trained CNN model from histopathology dataset
    2. Train the combined model and evaluate
